# Overview

This is the api for an assessment that was sent to me by the wonderful people of SovTech, it was a full-stack assessment requireming me to develop both the api and client. You can find the client side repository at [SovTech Client](https://github.com/CorrieGra/sovtech-client).

## The Challenge 

1. You should develop an Apollo GraphQL API 
2. Your GraphQL API should wrap the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/)
3. Your GraphQL API should have a Query type that resolves all People (https://swapi.dev/api/people/), but only the Person's details (name, height, mass, gender, homeworld).
4. The People Query should cater for pagination, you will notice the next property in the response. When given a page number, the respective People page should be returned (i.e. https://swapi.dev/api/people/?page=2)
5. Your GraphQL API should have a Query type that resolves (searches for) a particular Person (People) given their name (i.e. https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=Anakin Skywalker)

## A Note From Me

This was my very first GraphQL api that I've developed so I kept it as simple as possible. I enjoyed the challenge and learning new technologies are always a pleasure for me ! I have a much better understanding of the language and enjoyed using it.

Thank you for the challenge !
